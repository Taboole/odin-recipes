    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This French onion beef and noodle dish tastes like an onion-y beef stroganoff topped with tasty fried onions. It's fancy enough for adults but very approachable for littles, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound beef stew meat</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups thinly sliced sweet onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton lower sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (10 1/2-ounce) can condensed French onion soup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) package wide or medium egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 (2.8-ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef stew meat. Cook until well-browned on all sides, stirring once or twice, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the Dutch oven. Add onion and garlic. Cook over medium heat until tender and starting to brown, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes. If needed, add a splash of broth to the Dutch oven. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Return beef to the Dutch oven. Add remaining broth, soup, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 25 to 30 minutes or until meat is tender</li>
        <li>Whisk together sour cream and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of hot broth mixture from the Dutch oven to the bowl. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add mixture back to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add egg noodles to the pot. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes or until noodles and beef are tender.</li>
        <li>Top servings with French-fried onions and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
